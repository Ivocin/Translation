1
00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:01,043
Hello!

2
00:00:01,428 --> 00:00:01,788
All right.

3
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:03,953
Everybody welcome you have made it.

4
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:07,668
This is this is a Open Source Friday.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,918
It's a Friday when we talked to opensource maintainers about the project they work on.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,364
Sometimes we actually contribute to project, sometimes we build projects.

7
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:19,564
And I'm super stoked to have Evan You here.

8
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:20,563
You: Hello!

9
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:21,597
Welcome.

10
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:25,280
And just above your head you've got the Vue logo.

11
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:26,436
You: Yes.

12
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:29,527
Creator of Vue, maintainer , one of the maintainers of Vue as well.

13
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,297
And why don't you go ahead to introduce yourself and tell us why you here today?

14
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:34,516
Sure.

15
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:35,568
My name is Evan You.

16
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,848
and I am I,

17
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:39,055
I wrote Vuejs.

18
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,926
I'm the lead，team leader of Vuejs.

19
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:47,815
But in the past few months I'm also been working on a project called Vite.

20
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,748
which is what I'm going to be talking about today.

21
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:52,548
So.

22
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:53,448
Yeah.

23
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,898
Vite was initially created somewhat related to Vue.

24
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,625
but now a kind of evolved into its own thing.

25
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:06,648
And I'm kind of hoping that it can benefit developers,

26
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,298
especially frontend developers,

27
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,498
not just few users,

28
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,388
like all friend of developers.

29
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:13,908
Excellent,

30
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:14,268
yeah,

31
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:15,468
and it's funny,

32
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:16,908
cause I've definitely.

33
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,498
I know we chatted what was a last week for a completely different project,

34
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,528
but I'd never heard Vite said out loud,

35
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:26,148
and I was called it Vite.

36
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:28,098
Yeah,

37
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:33,588
A lot of people discovered that I don't know like I picked,

38
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:34,338
I picked the name.

39
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:36,228
It's actually a French word.

40
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,498
and French means fast or quickly,

41
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,458
So.

42
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:42,228
In fact,

43
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:42,888
It's cool too,

44
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,988
to stick to its original pronunciation,

45
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:49,758
but we are now living in a dilemma because some people are like.

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,338
If Vite is pronounced in the French way,

47
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:56,238
then why isn't Vue pronounced in the French way?

48
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,458
Cause Vue is actually a French word as well.

49
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,248
So too bad.

50
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:02,658
My own explanation is.

51
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:07,758
Just stick to whatever the author prefers.

52
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,108
I guess.

53
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,218
Yeah,

54
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:10,488
Sorry.

55
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,278
I was just messing with the screens because they did see that somewhere.

56
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:13,428
Oh,

57
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:15,738
here we go a French word for fast,

58
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:20,758
So all are the tips on how to speak French is right here in the README as well.

59
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,809
So appreciate Evan doing that.

60
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:24,854
Excellent.

61
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:28,982
So I guess what's the over, the high level of what would Vite is?

62
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:31,068
Like fast is one of the key words,

63
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,802
But like how would you describe it yet?

64
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:38,271
It's actually a little hard, which is why every time people asked me to explain what it is like.

65
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:43,428
There's no really concise one sentence description of it.

66
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:49,188
But if you want to make a comparison like if you have been using,

67
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:52,848
I think the closest thing in existence is Parcel, like the,

68
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,748
in terms of what it does and what a kind of affords you.

69
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:57,138
But.

70
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:01,818
Parcel bundler,

71
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,168
Google is help me today.

72
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:03,558
Yeah,

73
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:07,848
but obviously like the differences in how it's implemented,

74
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:13,392
and in terms of how the dev server works is fundamentally different.

75
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:15,438
But in terms of what it does,

76
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:22,248
you can think of it as something that takes some of your code and serve it.

77
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:22,578
Yeah,

78
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:29,628
I think it's really interesting because it's a dev server and a pre-configured bundler all in the same thing.

79
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:33,108
So like we can call it a frontend build tool.

80
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:38,302
But that's so generic, people just kind of ... It doesn't really explain anything in itself,

81
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:43,608
So I'm kind of struggling to come up with a really concise way to describe what it is,

82
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:44,358
which is why,

83
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:53,538
like I kind of want to do this livestream because I think it's actually easier to just show people like what it does and how it works,

84
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:56,118
so you get a very direct understanding of all.

85
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,408
This is what it is like.

86
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,938
This is what Vite is.

87
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,468
Yeah,

88
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:02,298
I think we're actually.

89
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,828
So I do a lot of frontend myself.

90
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,298
I come from like a React background.

91
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,228
I've kind of some Vue projects too, on GitHub as well.

92
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:11,621
And I feel like we're going through an evolution that we're sort of seeing.

93
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,458
I think we saw this five years ago,

94
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:14,268
probably longer than that,

95
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:17,777
with like Webpack and how folks that's sort of adopted.

96
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,919
That's type a bundler.

97
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:22,909
I might try to keep bundler is so you know as a one to one comparison.

98
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:22,913
Because I know you're having trouble describing what this is.

99
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:25,922
Because I know you're having trouble describing what this is.

100
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,578
But I think we are looking for an evolution.

101
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:37,218
I think we are now seeing even some of the hosting providers who are now adding all these bells and whistles and new features like we're ready for our next to the next wave,

102
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,269
And that's why the stream is called next the next frontier,

103
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:42,888
Alright, what is the steam called?

104
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,108
I accept the title and I don't even know what it's called.

105
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:48,468
But the next frontend tool tooling system generation.

106
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:49,098
That's what it was.

107
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,528
We are excellent.

108
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:55,608
So what ... why Vite at this point in time?

109
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:01,014
So I think Vite is essentially a ... a

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,868
Vite alongside you know snowpack, WMR, @web/dev-server.

111
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:15,408
I think we all come at a time where native ES modules has finally somewhat reached its close to being universally available.

112
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:16,389
Finally,

113
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,874
If we disregard IE 11.

114
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:30,288
Then the latest version of all these major browsers all support native ES modules it now usable in GitHub as well.

115
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:37,398
So the ecosystem is finally now starting to to do the sort of huge migration warrior.

116
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,388
Everyone is find OK,

117
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,208
we have a standard module system now,

118
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,248
and it runs natively in the browser.

119
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:47,958
So all the a lot of the assumptions about tooling,

120
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,548
especially like if a tooling.

121
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,855
If you assume that all the code is going to be standard ES modules.

122
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,318
You can link up a lot of stuff.

123
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:07,769
you can delegate a lot of stuff to browsers or some tools that just handle specific parts of the work flow faster than existing tools.

124
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,338
And I think that's where this next generation of tools is going to be focused on.

125
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,748
Is,

126
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,078
You know,

127
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,468
Finally,

128
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:21,018
We have this native standard module system that's going to be somewhat universal,

129
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:34,878
And how can we sort of reimagined the tooling and just kind of take this opportunity to rethink how but what a clean slate or a faster version of what we are doing today could be like.

130
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:36,318
Yeah,

131
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,998
so speak of a fast,

132
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:41,898
I know we prepared to share some screens to as well.

133
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:49,758
I don't know if we want to jump in and give like high level of what to do when Vite and how to sort of get in get installed or involved with the project.

134
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:50,478
Ah,

135
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:50,778
sure,

136
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:51,168
yeah,

137
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,858
so I think I'm just going to start sharing my screen right now,

138
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:58,218
so I think that's going to be there.

139
00:06:58,219 --> 00:06:58,698
All right,

140
00:06:58,699 --> 00:06:59,778
so,

141
00:06:59,779 --> 00:06:59,988
yeah,

142
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:01,129
so this is my screen.

143
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:05,297
If you want to get started,

144
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:09,826
it's going to ask you to use GitHub and like use this init @vitejs/app.

145
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,498
But this is really for you know,

146
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,978
for people who don't want to go through like many stuff,

147
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,538
but like to do what I'm not going to do that.

148
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:20,058
So what I want to do today is just like.

149
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:26,088
Here is a fresh demo like I have an empty demo folder.

150
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:27,258
There's nothing here,

151
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:31,277
so I'm just going to do yarn add vite.

152
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,298
There are -D vite.

153
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:34,868
Are you going to make this bigger?

154
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:39,018
So I just think started,

155
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,268
Ah, it doesn't scroll to the end.

156
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:41,598
Why?

157
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:44,658
Okay,

158
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,118
so and start pretty fast,

159
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:48,348
So Vite is

160
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:50,268
Let's take a look at the node modules.

161
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,318
It's 18 megabytes,

162
00:07:51,319 --> 00:08:02,298
so it's also very small amount of modules that's actually being installed because we prebundle most of them to just make sure that installs faster.

163
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,488
This is why,

164
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:07,008
compared to something like maybe create-react-app,

165
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:15,528
you're probably going to have you guys probably going to see a noticeable differences in terms of just installing this thing itself by how faster,

166
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,578
how much faster it is.

167
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,818
So now we have this thing here.

168
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:22,428
Yes,

169
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:23,868
I have these.

170
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,838
Let's just ignore all of the existing stuff I'm just going to put it in here.

171
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,918
you explain what we're looking at.

172
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,548
Here is well,

173
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,438
these are the node modules.

174
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,278
Yeah,

175
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,148
so this is just after you npm install or yarn add.

176
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:39,078
and this is just what it creates just doesn't really matter.

177
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:41,778
So I'm just going to create a html file.

178
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:46,398
And say hello.

179
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:54,588
And then I'm going to, so you can do npx vite here.

180
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,098
case up your terminal when they're a little bit.

181
00:08:58,099 --> 00:08:58,938
OK,

182
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,198
let's just move it here.

183
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:00,498
Then.

184
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:04,068
Okay,

185
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:07,068
All I am going to just going here add a script.

186
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:11,238
So I'm going to say dev vite.

187
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:14,478
And then.

188
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,347
Oh,

189
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,456
yarn dev.

190
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:23,808
So I started a dev server.

191
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:30,664
Notice that I didn't do anything other than just running this.

192
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:35,900
so you can kind of think at the bare minimum think of it as a static file server.

193
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:42,798
You probably use something like serve or like a http static server,

194
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,188
whatever,

195
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:49,878
like whatever your static files that were used to locally serve as a directory of static files right here,

196
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,852
Just a vite command does that at the bare minimum.

197
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,968
So you see Hello.

198
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,185
And that's the index.html being served.

199
00:09:58,185 --> 00:09:58,188
So this I kind of like the so I use a lot by npx serve as a serve npm package.

200
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:05,804
So this I kind of like the so I use a lot by npx serve as a serve npm package.

201
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:06,708
Yeah,

202
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,038
OK,

203
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,018
So so far out of the box,

204
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:13,608
I can get a very similar command to serve the static files.

205
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:14,868
So it's a static file server,

206
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:19,308
but it's not obviously it's not meant for serving it in production right here.

207
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:21,198
does are these development stuff?

208
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:26,928
So I edit and save and how we get like page reload out of the box.

209
00:10:28,398 --> 00:10:30,258
And with native modules.

210
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,824
With native ESM.

211
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,308
you can do script type of module right so you can do.

212
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,378
You can either do import here in line.

213
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,478
let's just do that actually main.js.

214
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,498
yes,

215
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:49,278
so it tells you failed to resolve a main.js because it doesn't exist.

216
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,868
So I'm going to create that here.

217
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:52,908
And.

218
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,308
So reload the page.

219
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,868
So make sure the console actually log hello.

220
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:05,388
so you also see vite connect thing,

221
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:08,058
which is our hot module replacement client.

222
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:11,388
That's being run,

223
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,848
so if you add it to your file here,

224
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:15,198
it also reloads the page.

225
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:23,178
And you can see this main.js file has been updated and reloaded so.

226
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:28,068
This is not a real hot module replacement going on because this is just simply reloading the page.

227
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,808
But it tracks all the things that's being import from your index.html.

228
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:35,778
To know that if you edit this file,

229
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:36,828
I need to reload the page.

230
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,728
If you add other things,

231
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,168
I don't need to care about it.

232
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:47,199
And then some of the common stuff that we may want to do is.

233
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:49,908
Like link to CSS files.

234
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:55,518
So let's just say style.css.

235
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:57,978
H1 color red.

236
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:07,833
You can obviously just use a link so style.css.

237
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,708
So notice here I can eh,

238
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:14,988
because it's an actual http server you can use like absolute paths,

239
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:17,508
here is just like what you'd expect.

240
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:21,198
So we got this thing showing red on the screen,

241
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,538
and if I edited here,

242
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:26,208
you're you're mentioned about the absolute paths,

243
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:27,348
somebody ask in the chat,

244
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:30,228
How to use of Vite from another folder than just root.

245
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:34,218
How to use it from another folder?

246
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:34,548
Yes,

247
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:41,118
I guess if you had like your CSS styles folder or I guess you could install the relative path to.

248
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:41,478
Yeah,

249
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,528
you can do relative paths,

250
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,048
you can even ideas stuff.

251
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:49,848
It also follows all the npm node modules resolve algorithm.

252
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:50,238
OK,

253
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:53,028
which will show in a bit,

254
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:53,808
but as you can see,

255
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:59,268
like even there the simple link here and notice how,

256
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,038
when I edit this thing,

257
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,798
the page actually didn't reload.

258
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:07,668
It's hot updating the CSS in place.

259
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:15,468
So what what's making that work is awesome Vite magic server? Magic？

260
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:15,858
Yeah,

261
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:18,978
So Vite is doing the work of recording the relationship.

262
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:25,728
So one thing I kind of want to point out is like when we have a lot of users coming from webpack.

263
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:33,438
there are so used to thinking of this main.js as their entry point of application and HTML being the afterthought.

264
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:37,396
So Vite is kind of think of it as a server.

265
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:37,398
So your HTML is actually your entry point and feed Vite parses everything here to consider it a module graph entry.

266
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:46,824
So your HTML is actually your entry point and feed Vite parses everything here to consider it a module graph entry.

267
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:51,108
So style CSS, is considered part of the module graph.

268
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:57,378
This thing is turning into an inline module and which imports this main.js which is another module.

269
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,338
So notice how like index.html is actually the entry point to the application.

270
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:03,048
And it's kind of from there.

271
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,838
We construct the whole module graph of the application.

272
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,927
Instead of like we're going from here,

273
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:13,068
they will go in backwards and figure out what HTML should be.

274
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,898
So that's kind of a thing.

275
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:22,008
A lot of people kind of have to sort of flip a switch in order to to get into Vite.

276
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,258
I think Parcel does this too, right.

277
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:29,478
So Parcel is kind of the pioneer of this concept of HTML being your entry and being part of the module graph.

278
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:32,958
and I think that's kind of the for web development.

279
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,668
In particular.

280
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,378
This is your stuff for me.

281
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:39,528
It's a more natural sort of mental module to work with,

282
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,818
but in a way right?

283
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:50,568
So what Vite does under the hood is we actually record these all these important relationships between the HTML and the CSS files.

284
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:54,108
So we can,

285
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:58,788
we get to actually just update this linked CSS in place,

286
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:01,038
and so that's right.

287
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,088
This is not too much different from, say, a static file server.

288
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:08,088
So some of the things we also do out of the box is.

289
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:15,091
Let's say we have styled.module.css.

290
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:18,283
I'm going to say er...

291
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:22,458
What is the module keyword, We've actually not seen that before.

292
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,168
So this is a convention I saw.

293
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:26,988
if you've worked with CSS modules,

294
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:30,725
it's kind of convention to name your files with this module.css.

295
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,338
And in Vite this is also a convention, so if you see, we see a file named like this,

296
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:38,178
and I'm going to say er..

297
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,058
.text

298
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:43,668
Color

299
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:45,438
Red

300
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:49,308
And then I'm going to comment out this one.

301
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:54,258
And I'm gonna, say import classes from.

302
00:15:55,638 --> 00:16:01,128
style.module.css

303
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,528
Let's just log this,

304
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,728
and as you can see,

305
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:07,218
it gives you this Object with text in it.

306
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:09,618
So this is a class name,

307
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:10,818
so I'm going to say.

308
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:16,121
document.querySelector

309
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:19,698
h1.className

310
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:23,508
equals classes.text.

311
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:29,208
And now again red here,

312
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:32,298
so if you edit this thing here,

313
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,858
it also reloads.

314
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,898
So this is not hot module replacement,

315
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,848
but but you get the idea right.

316
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:40,248
so we have a lot of these big conventions here.

317
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,168
So imagine if you are.

318
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,988
You previously had a project with plain webpack,

319
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:49,035
and now you say I want to work with CSS modules,

320
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:54,816
you probably have to go through a guide to teach you what CSS loader is, what style loader is.

321
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,777
Yes，I've definitely been that path.

322
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:04,488
Then you need to look at all the PostCSS configurations for to CSS loader add those loaders on webpack config again.

323
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:05,718
You get what I mean right.

324
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:09,648
So the idea of Vite is it's pretty opinionated.

325
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:20,238
It has a lot of these kinds of things it's things built in and to sort of minimize the hoops you need to jump through to get certain things working.

326
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:20,836
Similarly,

327
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:20,838
if you want to have custom PostCSS configs,

328
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,522
if you want to have custom PostCSS configs,

329
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:26,778
so you just add post.config.js.

330
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:30,348
The export CSS config.

331
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:30,918
So this is.

332
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:35,827
This is similar to how you get the Tailwind CSS working.

333
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,312
Because Tailwind itself is really a PostCSS plugin.

334
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,558
So if you configure,

335
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,858
you want to configure Tailwind with Vite.

336
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,538
Ah,

337
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,468
Let's see,

338
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,148
how can we get that working out?

339
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:53,148
Proudly be to go to Tailwind CSS.

340
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:57,558
And I'm going to look for Vite.

341
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,198
I think there is a guide with Vite here.

342
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,038
Yes,

343
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,148
So why are you looking for that?

344
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,518
There's some some question that came in the chat room.

345
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,737
Is there so similar, like create-react-app, is there like an eject feature, or as you just get Vite?

346
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:16,308
So here's the thing like there's really no need to eject.

347
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,708
So Vite has its own configuration format,

348
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,948
but it's not based on webpack, the idea is,

349
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:24,588
CSS module is something that just works in Vite.

350
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:28,636
there's really like if you want to configure it as you can,

351
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:28,638
you just create a vite.config.js and you can say export defaults.

352
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:35,235
you just create a vite.config.js and you can say export defaults.

353
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,460
CSS modules.

354
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:47,065
then these options will be passed on to the PostCSS modules plugin so you can configure like,

355
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,591
localsConvention.

356
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,828
To be camelCaseOnly if you want.

357
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:57,708
If you use CSS modules you, you know what this does,

358
00:18:57,709 --> 00:19:01,428
but like most of these building stuff is also configurable.

359
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:02,388
But the thing is.

360
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:07,574
My personal opinion is because I've worked...

361
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:07,578
We maintain Vue CLI for Vue right here , and the CLI is built on top of webpack.

362
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:12,253
We maintain Vue CLI for Vue right here , and the CLI is built on top of webpack.

363
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:17,778
And we ship a lot of these stuff out of the box, infuse enthusiasm as well.

364
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:22,608
So we have in some way if you use Vite with Vue.

365
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:30,914
You almost scared identical feature set with Vue CLI in terms of what you can do with source code.

366
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:30,918
But we have to maintain a pretty complicated webpack config internally.

367
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:36,763
But we have to maintain a pretty complicated webpack config internally.

368
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:42,078
And when people want to configure that it's typically quite involved.

369
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:49,127
An ideal with Vite is we essentially extracted.

370
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:50,898
A lot of these things that we know,

371
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:55,788
like users will need this in a typical project,

372
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,528
and also because,

373
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,758
over time,

374
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:04,938
a kind of in Vue CLI, we've come to these conclusion like this is kind of the sensible default.

375
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,558
Most people will want this,

376
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,938
so that's how are we going to present it in Vite by default as well.

377
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:14,028
And if there are certain things that you,

378
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,278
we know that users will want to customize,

379
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,808
we expose them via an option.

380
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:20,808
Add the plugin system,

381
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,328
Vite is also pretty flexible,

382
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:26,598
but I don't think we want to dig into that.

383
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:31,548
So I guess understanding these conventions,

384
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:38,654
like as I was talking about the bundlers and how we've sort of advanced now where everybody like new things to look forward to the next generation.

385
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:44,538
I love the fact that there are strong opinions happening now in frontend JavaScript world.

386
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:51,318
because when you talk about like a webpack like I am triggered where I've definitely got to a point where I want to use this new things,

387
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,968
like Tailwind at the time,

388
00:20:52,969 --> 00:21:03,468
and but I don't know how to get it, like in my webpack config and there's sometimes some plugins some hoops I have to jump through, sometimes two different plugins that are competing against each other for space.

389
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:04,968
and sometimes I need both of them,

390
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:09,378
and I've sort of been burnt out enough about that situation.

391
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:13,458
But it sounds like in Vite, one of the steps is working on the box.

392
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:13,848
Yeah,

393
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:25,600
I think, it's so be more strong opinionated. I think it's just a different value proposition and different sort of where how at which level the tool want to live here.

394
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:30,228
Webpack itself I think is still kind of very low level.

395
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:40,608
The downside is when you have such a low level abstraction and you want to allow all the higher level features to be configurable in user space.

396
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:43,548
The complexity just explodes,

397
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:44,718
whereas if you,

398
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,158
if the tool comes in and say,

399
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:46,368
hey,

400
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:47,718
I just want to be opinionated.

401
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:58,308
so I can manage much more for the user and because the tool gets to manage all these things together so the tool gets to sort of work.

402
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,378
All your systems is somewhat smoother because you have more control at the tooling layer,

403
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:11,778
instead of forcing the user to figure out all of these, how to get plugging feature B to be compatible with feature B on that,

404
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:25,608
and I think it's not necessarily saying like I think it's actually a miracle that you can make all these things work with webpack just like looking at all the plugins and loaders that you put together by.

405
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:27,588
But you know,

406
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:34,096
I think we come to the conclusion that most users don't really want to deal with that.

407
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:40,488
So if the tool can sort of already handled most of these stuff in an opinionated way for them,

408
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:45,018
they are happy to sort of just follow along,

409
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,128
and I think that takes some too,

410
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:46,398
because,

411
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:50,928
like we as an ecosystem, as the community we need,

412
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,718
we needed something to pave the way, like webpack.

413
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:57,408
then we try to put all these things together on top of webpack.

414
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:57,978
and then we realize,

415
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:58,398
okay.

416
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:04,758
We finally come to the sort of almost a shared convention like how we deal with CSS.

417
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,428
How would you deal with certain types features right?

418
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,288
So if you look at things across,

419
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,858
like create-react-app or Vue-CLI or Next.js.

420
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,348
A lot of stuff that is shared, right.

421
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:17,778
They were doing a lot of similar stuff on top of webpack.

422
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:21,108
So I think we've finally reached his harm.

423
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:26,088
Where most users almost take some of these as sort of granted,

424
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:26,628
they think.

425
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:26,928
Oh,

426
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:29,328
it's natural that I am able to import CSS.

427
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:34,578
It's natural that I am able to just use PostCSS out of the box,

428
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,878
so I think Vite is in some way.

429
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:38,748
it's like,

430
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:39,198
OK.

431
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:41,748
If that's what people are used to already,

432
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:46,308
then we can sort of just go directly to provided out of the box.

433
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:51,168
And so question,

434
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,048
so we just saw you do a bunch of commands with Vite.

435
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:55,278
How about like,

436
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,778
How do we compare this with the Vue CLI they are going to be working together eventually,

437
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,148
or do they work together today?

438
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,358
They don't work together today because Vue CLI is still webpack based.

439
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,548
So in the long term,

440
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:13,188
we're probably want to eventually migrate Vue CLI to be Vite based.

441
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:19,308
So Vue CLI in terms of scope is a little bit higher level than Vite.

442
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:22,848
because it also includes scaffolding.

443
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:25,458
It has more built in scaffolding.

444
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:27,528
It has this.

445
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:34,818
It's plugin system which I don't know if we want to keep if we eventually migrate Vite.

446
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:46,848
But Vue CLI lives at a higher level where its view specific has more scaffolding and also gives you more opinionated integration with like test runners and all this stuff.

447
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:49,638
So it's a more complete solution,

448
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:50,148
So.

449
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:51,798
It's interesting,

450
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,158
yes,

451
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,718
so Vite is like higher level than webpack but lower level than Vue CLI, somewhere in between.

452
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,678
Got it,

453
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:00,918
yeah,

454
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:01,668
I mean,

455
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:04,608
I'm looking forward to seeing things like that being integrated the Vue CLI

456
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:08,538
because I like the opinion that you get with the CLI because I don't want...

457
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:15,348
I spent a lot of time working through different frameworks and different projects that I have the context which quite a bit,

458
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,488
especially in my role.

459
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:16,938
I'd get home,

460
00:25:16,939 --> 00:25:20,838
you know we just ship or on a random stuff and then move on to the next thing.

461
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,998
I think it's like a dev raw thing really,

462
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:28,188
and I imagine folks you do like they do a lot of production sites in like agencies.

463
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:29,328
So my question is,

464
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,948
Is Vite

465
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:35,568
extendable and other different frameworks within the JavaScript ecosystem.

466
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:36,048
Yeah,

467
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:36,378
yeah,

468
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:37,758
definitely,

469
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,468
so we have,

470
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:41,658
so There are several different ways to look at it.

471
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:42,408
So first of all,

472
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:44,268
Vite is framework agnostic,

473
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:49,008
so you can use Vite to work with almost any like framework of choice.

474
00:25:49,009 --> 00:26:00,468
And then Vite itself exposes a pretty pretty well defined JavaScript API so you can use Vite inside a higher level tool.

475
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:03,438
So an example is VitePress,

476
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:07,968
which is a static site generator that is built on top of Vite.

477
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:12,588
It actually wraps Vite internally and does a bunch of opinioned Vite stuff on top of it,

478
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:16,548
which I can probably show around,

479
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,228
show it a bit.

480
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:19,308
Do you have something to prepare?

481
00:26:20,388 --> 00:26:21,108
Not really,

482
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:21,738
but if so,

483
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:30,348
it is pretty cool because it doesn't really need like I really like this life seemed that I can just show how it works instead of talking about it.

484
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:30,978
Actually,

485
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:31,638
yeah,

486
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:32,538
I personally,

487
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:32,628
I,

488
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:34,068
we talked about this before were alive,

489
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:40,098
but I wanted to have the fact. And I know a lot of folks are downstream haven't been here before on Open Source Friday,

490
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,368
but it's an opportunity for us to have conversations about projects.

491
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:51,948
Open up the web browser and talk as opposed to like a podcast where you get a lot of high level and sort of walk through different patterns without getting they'll actually show it.

492
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:59,907
And then I'm going to have any bill read the show notes. But it's nice to see is just give us the examples this right here and right in front of us.

493
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:08,463
So I'm going to just like quickly good Tailwind going because so this is just installing a bunch of stuff,

494
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,608
so I'm going to use yarn add

495
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:15,288
-D with all these Tailwind stuff,

496
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:19,218
so these are just like standard dependencies that Tailwind wants you to install.

497
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:22,218
Once you install that,

498
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:24,138
I'm going to tailwind.

499
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:28,518
There's that tailwindcss init -P.

500
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:45,738
So if you're wondering why I was able to run that without the npx prefix because I configured my path to include the the node_modules in the current directory.

501
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:53,418
So I can always run the basing in the current node_modules in the current directory without any prefix.

502
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:53,748
Ok.

503
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:57,108
That's this your personal development to its environment.

504
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:57,318
Yeah,

505
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,148
that's just a thing that I do.

506
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:00,708
Okay,

507
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:00,978
I mean,

508
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:07,338
I love the other thing I love about this is I get to learn from other people who were at how to write code to think I'm pair programming for you,

509
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,768
but I'm really this sort of in the passenger seat.

510
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:10,638
Watch a new code.

511
00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:12,708
And yeah,

512
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:14,418
I love this cool.

513
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:17,568
Just a hands up

514
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:23,538
So I just created this tailwind config this postcss.config.js

515
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:26,298
so there is really nothing special to do here.

516
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,598
Other than this thing I mean,

517
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,468
this is kind of.

518
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:34,698
Some of these specific so ignore this,

519
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:38,088
because this is like a tailwind specific thing,

520
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,688
but this is the source code you want to actually just copy and put it here.

521
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:48,138
And just reenable this.

522
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,318
And then OK,

523
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:56,988
so pages actually already reloaded is so I think I should have tailwind CSS in there.

524
00:28:56,989 --> 00:28:57,978
so I want to.

525
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:03,678
I don't use tailwind css just like enough

526
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,578
I think something like class = 3xl

527
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,508
No？

528
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:08,868
no.

529
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:12,048
Actually,

530
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:13,518
if anybody want to be a tailwind expert

531
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,038
if you want to drop whatever the,

532
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:16,188
oh,

533
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,058
it's text dash.

534
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,758
text-3xl

535
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,774
This is the anthoer thing that programming on Twitch

536
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:29,688
Ah, so it doesn't really work wondering why it's not working.

537
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:30,733
Let's see.

538
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:33,618
I don't know if you have a chat open,

539
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:39,198
but text-3xl

540
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:41,778
Everybody is now searching the docks where you two as well.

541
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,098
Yeah,

542
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:43,278
well,

543
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:51,588
it's not actually updating the index.html doesn't mean that all because I'm actually overriding should hear here.

544
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,058
so now text-3xl

545
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:56,778
and still isn't really working so styled with CSS.

546
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:01,218
So the cool thing about so another thing I want to show case here is when you are debugging with something like Vite.

547
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:03,978
because we don't concoct need everything.

548
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:08,628
So the easiest way to debug stuff is just looking at the network tab.

549
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:12,258
Vite's every module is actually a individual request here,

550
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:18,228
so I'm just going to look at this and it's not really doing anything.

551
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:18,588
Yeah,

552
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:21,453
I think this is because I didn't restart the server.

553
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:28,458
is importing the tailwind library file?

554
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:29,088
You go,

555
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:29,328
Ah,

556
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,018
there are OK,

557
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,518
Something changed.

558
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:31,968
Yeah,

559
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:39,378
so I restarted server because they didn't know the post css config previously, it cached.

560
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,128
Before we start,

561
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,688
I added the postcss config,

562
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:44,868
and the server was like I didn't notice.

563
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:45,798
it's already here,

564
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:51,408
It just goes to show that even Evan You needs to debug?

565
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:55,218
Sometimes I get this line of code on a whim.

566
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:55,968
Yeah,

567
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:56,268
OK.

568
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:58,878
And then looking at the index.html

569
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:02,178
we're not importing the tailwind CSS , ...we are, got it.

570
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:03,618
we're using this link here,

571
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:05,178
got it so so it works,

572
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:05,898
as you can see.

573
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:09,528
PostCSS also works over these normal links,

574
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:15,018
because this is treated as a dependency in Vite land as well.

575
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:19,188
So if you have like nested at imports inside the CSS file,

576
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:20,658
we also trace all of that.

577
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:24,288
We also kind of record the module graph, the dependency chain,

578
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,158
so you add it like nested at import CSS files.

579
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,008
We also do hot module replacement and all that.

580
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:33,078
ah,

581
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:33,378
OK,

582
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:38,058
so that's if I think we're going to wrap it up here for CSS

583
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:38,598
it's actually.

584
00:31:40,008 --> 00:31:44,252
Maybe also showcase something like

585
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:48,108
I'm going to yarn add -D sass

586
00:31:49,938 --> 00:31:57,228
So I'm just installing sass itself and I'm going to create a new file called style.scss

587
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,348
Then color.

588
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:03,558
Red, is that the syntax?

589
00:32:06,768 --> 00:32:09,378
So I wrote some scss

590
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,338
And I'm going to just link it like this.

591
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:19,518
So,

592
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:19,788
yeah,

593
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:23,748
so you install says and then you can use sass or scss

594
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:25,188
and it just works like this.

595
00:32:25,189 --> 00:32:25,758
Of course,

596
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,568
you can also do it like this if you want.

597
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:31,848
Or it's the same way.

598
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:38,898
Or you can do.

599
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:43,698
Something like this.

600
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:49,231
Also works.

601
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:55,518
so most of the commission of stuff that you expect that should work，it probably will work.

602
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:07,578
And this is because we didn't do anything here is I'm just going to change this to style.scss

603
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:09,648
And reloads the page.

604
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:15,648
And then real quick going back to the vite config

605
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:17,328
We didn't do much to set this up.

606
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,758
We did create some post growth,

607
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,248
there was the config that we had before,

608
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:24,318
so we didn't really do anything too.

609
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:24,798
Yeah,

610
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,878
this work,

611
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,048
we didn't really like ...

612
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:32,718
This is actually unnecessary , I know because I was just showing how you can customize CSS modules here.

613
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,198
OK,

614
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:33,768
excellent,

615
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:34,848
Yeah,

616
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,228
so technically,

617
00:33:36,229 --> 00:33:39,768
like anything you don't need just like remove them,

618
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,279
and it doesn't affect anything.

619
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,012
if you just want sass like this is all you need to work with sass

620
00:33:47,886 --> 00:34:02,719
So really like it's more like if you want to go the super super minimal route, like you just have your HTML CSS and JavaScript optionally with CSS or a preprocessor like this.

621
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:09,577
This is not much from a static file server except it magically knows some of the stuff that you want to use.

622
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:11,208
Okay,

623
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:11,568
So.

624
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:18,768
So this is for people who want to just like have a you know, a smarter server,

625
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:20,808
But we can do more than this obviously.

626
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:26,538
So one use case that I have and because they are doing so much to twitch streaming this year,

627
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:30,408
and we've just had a live stream last week me and Michelle,

628
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,938
Michelle from Australia I was given,

629
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:33,258
and then though I was making the distinction.

630
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:36,138
But we build a twitch bot,

631
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,438
and then one thing I've noticed what things like OBS

632
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:41,654
so like right now we're leveraging obs to get everything on the screen at the moment.

633
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:50,350
is that it has a JavaScript runtime and I've been messing around with using like Deno and js time inside of OBS,

634
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,998
I haven't really published anything that works yet,

635
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:56,478
but I'm curious of things like we talked about typescript,

636
00:34:56,479 --> 00:35:00,612
but what about things like Deno will that be compatible

637
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,318
Deno Probably so,

638
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:07,998
Deno is a whole different story because the signal is it's own thing.

639
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:11,878
So Vite is currently built on top of Node.js API

640
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:15,108
So that's not going to be travelled to get it running in Deno

641
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:15,558
OK,

642
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,248
that's good to know.

643
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:18,768
All right,

644
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:21,918
so let's see what we can do next.

645
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:26,088
I'm going to add a dependency now,

646
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:28,038
so let's say,

647
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:30,558
I want to use React.

648
00:35:34,158 --> 00:35:39,258
So I added react and react-dom inside main.js

649
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:43,128
We probably want to change this to jsx because we are going to use some JSX.

650
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,808
So I'm going to say import React from react

651
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:50,088
ah.

652
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:51,858
Import.

653
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:55,128
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'

654
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:56,268
I think that's how it works.

655
00:35:58,368 --> 00:36:02,230
So forgive me because I'm actually er ...

656
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:06,513
ReactDom.render

657
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:09,899
We all came to watch Evan You write React

658
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:14,868
getElementById app,

659
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:15,318
maybe.

660
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:20,718
So that means we need to have something here.

661
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,287


662
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:32,598
So the main thing I would actually show casing here is not really like React

663
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,008
but we need a App

664
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:34,908
So function App.

665
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:40,938
return h1 hello

666
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:42,858
So let's see.

667
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:45,798
No.

668
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:49,158
Of course,

669
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,298
ah,

670
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:54,558
because we change it to main.jsx so and kept a check to here.

671
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,278
Alright,

672
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,478
so you get hello on the web

673
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:59,508
so this is rendered by React,

674
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,478
and as you can see, jsx just kind of worked out of the box as well.

675
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:04,728
You didn't need to configure anything.

676
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:14,448
it kind of just worked so same for if you use tsx.

677
00:37:16,578 --> 00:37:21,108
And let's do that export function app like this.

678
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,918
So remember,

679
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:26,058
you need to react because we are using the we have sixteen transform.

680
00:37:27,618 --> 00:37:29,028
And instead of that,

681
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:35,948
I'm going to say imports {App} from './App'.

682
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:39,888
And it works the same way so.

683
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:46,698
So typescript jsx tsx works out of the box.

684
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:49,578
you can just import them and they just work.

685
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,238
Ah,

686
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,088
you didn't even need to install typescript itself.

687
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:59,958
The assumption here is you will likely be doing type check,

688
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:05,441
And so when you're developing your IDE probably know something.

689
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:12,882
So you can add a ts config here and your IDE will start linting these ts files and give you errors and warnings.

690
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:16,848
So Vite itself doesn't care about any of the type checks.

691
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:22,068
All it does is transform the syntax into actual JavaScript that the browser can understand.

692
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:22,458
Ah,

693
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:26,358
and it does that using esbuild so this is where we start to

694
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:29,598
I should already leveraged esbuilding two places up to this point.

695
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,748
The first is esbuild is transforming these jsx and tsx files into plain js for us.

696
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:38,898
So for those who don't know what esbuild is,

697
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:45,288
It's a javascript build tool transpile tool that's written in Go.

698
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,708
So it's written it's compiled to native binaries.

699
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:51,348
And it's extremely extremely fast.

700
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:54,228
And that was shipped pretty recently wasn't it ？

701
00:38:54,229 --> 00:38:55,670
It's actually been around for a while.

702
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:57,288
yeah,

703
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:00,498
maybe it just made the newsletters recently

704
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:01,488
Yeah,

705
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:01,788
I mean,

706
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:06,918
it takes a time for these kinds of projects to mature because it's covering so much features but eh..

707
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,298
But the basic idea here is.

708
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:13,068
When you installed Vite were already installed esbuild for you,

709
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:16,938
so you don't. You don't need to install anything extra to get these translations,

710
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:23,118
and this is at least twenty to thirty times faster than vanilla tsc.

711
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:30,678
So tsc you will probably take like thirty forty milliseconds to transpile tsx file,

712
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:34,864
But with esbuild it's like one millisecond most of the time.

713
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:42,888
And Vite leverage is that so imagine if you have a project like one hundred ts files,

714
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:45,678
so that kind of add up.

715
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:48,828
Another aspect of this is when we started server here.

716
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:49,848
notice this thing here,

717
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:52,368
says new dependency found react and react-dom。

718
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:59,898
If you are used to using React with like, create-react-app or webpack,

719
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:04,338
you kind of used to like doing like import React from react like this,

720
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,198
and it just works,

721
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:08,778
and sometimes we may even do things like you know,

722
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:13,548
named exports like this,

723
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:16,818
but if you actually look at what the files React is shipping.

724
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,707
Let's going to React here and look at the package.json here.

725
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:27,918
it says main: index.js

726
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:32,928
so index.js it says module.exports equals require blah, blah blah.

727
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,458
And this is actually CommonJS.

728
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:38,880
So React doesn't ship native es modules, it ships CommonJS.

729
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,508
Ships CommonJS,

730
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:46,248
but we are able to just imported like an actual es module here,

731
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:48,776
so there is obviously something going on in the background.

732
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:53,328
Eh, webpack, Rollup you know, if you use this with Rollup

733
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,993
you will need something like rollup-plugin-commonjs.

734
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,358
Webpack does a lot of the interrupt behind the behind the scene.

735
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,398
But how do we get to make React actually working the browser?

736
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:06,618
So let's take a look at the network here.

737
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:11,418
Ah,

738
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:11,718
ah,

739
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,198
God,

740
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:12,648
how do I?

741
00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:18,618
I can't get to grab this part anyway.

742
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:21,528
So here's the React

743
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:25,878
Notice that we are getting this require_react,

744
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:29,838
so this all of this code is actually generated by esbuild

745
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,798
So.

746
00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:33,408
When we restart the server,

747
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,188
if I say.

748
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:37,998
vite --force.

749
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:41,448
There is a thing here,

750
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,668
What's the force command.

751
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:44,868
The force means.

752
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:49,248
Ignore the dependency cache reforce process all the dependencies.

753
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:50,208
OK, intresting

754
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:50,388
yeah,

755
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:52,218
so if you don't,

756
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,328
if you don't do that,

757
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:54,288
it won't.

758
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:55,518
It will check some hash,

759
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,658
and if the hash matches,

760
00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:59,478
you won't need to do anything when you restart the server.

761
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:01,398
But if you've passed a force it will

762
00:42:03,408 --> 00:42:04,638
You just didn't pass the force.

763
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,708
So it will detect it.

764
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:11,838
So what Vite is doing here is,

765
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,918
it will look at your source code,

766
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:15,459
notice you are relying on react and react-dom.

767
00:42:15,514 --> 00:42:20,958
And then it will check react and react-dom and notice they are not actually es modules.

768
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,148
which means we need to do something about them,

769
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:32,479
So we will use esbuild to process them prebundle them into something that actually works in the browser as native es modules.

770
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:37,578
And we have some also smart interrupts so that you can use named exports,

771
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:41,328
even though technically,

772
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:47,328
A CommonJS module transform to es module only has a single default export,

773
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:54,738
But we kind of make that work with some some runtime interrupt,

774
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,408
And the benefit of this is kind of twofold.

775
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:04,098
The first is you make CommonJS modules work as native ES modules.

776
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:09,258
Another benefit of this is say you have something like lodash-es.

777
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:12,048
Lodash-es has like six hundred internal modules.

778
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,578
When you import lodash-es

779
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:16,398
Without any optimization,

780
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:20,538
you are loading all those six six hundred modules here.

781
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:20,808
So,

782
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:23,148
if you look at the network tab when you load.

783
00:43:24,288 --> 00:43:28,231
Maybe I can just do that in yarn add lodash-es

784
00:43:29,088 --> 00:43:35,327
And I'm going to say import _ from 'lodash-es'

785
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:38,778
Well,

786
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:43,128
that didn't actually resulting in a lot of request because our server,

787
00:43:43,129 --> 00:43:49,308
the Vite servers smartly detect a lodash-es and chunked into a single file on the fly.

788
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:53,088
So if we didn't do that,

789
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:57,918
you'll this will you will see like six hundred requests here and it's going to jam the browser,

790
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:59,718
even though it's relatively fast,

791
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:03,948
it's like there are still a lot of overhead when you process an http request.

792
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,028
so ideally,

793
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:05,748
even during dev,

794
00:44:05,749 --> 00:44:07,458
we still want to reduce number requests.

795
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:16,758
but we'd kind of does this for you so that even if you import a dependency with even a thousand internal modules,

796
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:23,448
we still kind of chunk it into a single file here and because we do that with esbuild.

797
00:44:23,449 --> 00:44:26,508
It's so fast like how much time it did.

798
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:31,098
This within like a second less than a second.

799
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:31,878
But if you do,

800
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:35,478
this would say something.

801
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:36,888
so this comes into play like,

802
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:41,208
because even were huge dependencies may be like.

803
00:44:42,798 --> 00:44:47,418
There are yarn add @material-ui/core.

804
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,278
So this is going to be pretty intense, right.

805
00:44:54,018 --> 00:44:56,418
import m from '@material-ui/core'.

806
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:03,468
So we finish that we imported material-ui/core.

807
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:04,158
Ah,

808
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,958
and still it takes less than a second.

809
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:06,378
Granted.

810
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:14,598
This is I'm running on an M1 ARM Mac which is insanely fast but still like this same thing.

811
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:15,558
If you process,

812
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,458
it will say webpack or a Rollup, you probably have to wait a few seconds.

813
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:28,097
And so this so this is where esbuild really makes this process just like insanely fast

814
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:31,218
And some of the noticeable differences like I've test.

815
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:37,422
This is tested this on a real world app using React and material-ui and a bunch of other dependencies.

816
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:45,438
And I try to pre bundle with Rollup and took me twenty eight seconds on M1 Mac.

817
00:45:45,498 --> 00:45:48,138
And we've got a curiosity are you on M1 mac right now

818
00:45:48,139 --> 00:45:48,648
Yes,

819
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:50,088
I am here.

820
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:50,268
Yeah,

821
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:52,758
there's speculation in the chat right now

822
00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:53,148
Yeah,

823
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:58,698
So after we switched Vite to use esbuild for this process,

824
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:02,088
it took one point five seconds.

825
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:06,528
so that's like twenty times faster startup time,

826
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:10,278
and because every time you detect a new import,

827
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:11,658
or you add new dependencies,

828
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:13,338
the cache will likely invalidates.

829
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:17,328
So you kind of have to do this relatively frequently.

830
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:23,287
So having esbuild handle this is just like a lifesaver because just like cut down the time so much.

831
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:25,278
Most of the time.

832
00:46:26,268 --> 00:46:29,748
With with M1 plus esbuild

833
00:46:29,749 --> 00:46:30,378
I'm just,

834
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:35,808
I'll start getting patient whenever I start a project and I have to wait more than one second.

835
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:37,038
You're any kind of.

836
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:37,308
Yeah,

837
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:38,598
I'm spoiled honestly.

838
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:49,638
And also note esbuild is currently still only ships Intel binary.

839
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:54,678
It doesn't have an apple silicon native binary of esbuild yet.

840
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:57,168
I think the latest version of Go does support it.

841
00:46:57,169 --> 00:47:01,878
But esbuild it hasn't really started shipping the ARM native binaries.

842
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:07,998
Yet so we are actually running esbuild on M1 Mac back through Rosetta 2.

843
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:11,568
so imagine it can be another like twenty to thirty percent faster.

844
00:47:11,569 --> 00:47:15,078
once we have native ARM Mac esbuild binaries.

845
00:47:17,328 --> 00:47:18,498
So,

846
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:18,828
yeah,

847
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:25,098
so this is part of where the Vite the fastness comes into play when you,

848
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:29,658
when you notice the difference when you have not just for a simple demo project,

849
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:32,718
when you have a real project with like hundreds of dependencies,

850
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:41,358
this is start to be a very, very significant It's very, very significant difference in terms of the DX, right.

851
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:51,258
So if you have to wait like half a minute or a whole minute before every time you spin up the dev server or I'm going to be really reluctant to even think about working on the project.

852
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:52,668
All right.

853
00:47:53,748 --> 00:47:56,658
And this kind of helps me with debugging tool,

854
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:57,048
because now,

855
00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:59,418
like every time someone reports a new thing,

856
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:01,548
I clone the reproduction.

857
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:03,138
It almost always starts instantly.

858
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:04,998
I don't have to like wait.

859
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:09,198
So it just makes debugging Vite itself also much more pleasant.

860
00:48:10,998 --> 00:48:11,268
Yeah,

861
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:11,508
I mean,

862
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:17,688
I've got some projects that do actually could be debugging a lot of my regular site actually takes quite some time for you to build,

863
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:20,298
so I won't drop any frameworks any names down,

864
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:22,278
but it's got some issues.

865
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:25,278
I do have little questions from the chat there.

866
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:28,368
What about our production and is Vite ready for production?

867
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:32,028
I know there's a beta flag on the 2.0 right now on the repo.

868
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:41,221
So we are actually pretty stable for the past few weeks on no major bugs left really.

869
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:49,998
So there are a few small edge cases if you have some particularly tricky dependencies where it's like a mix of ES modules in CommonJS,

870
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:52,578
there may be small issues,

871
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:59,838
but for the most parts we already have close to thirty thousand downloads per week and.

872
00:49:01,818 --> 00:49:04,308
The latest few versions has been pretty stable,

873
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:06,798
so I think we are going out of beta pretty soon.

874
00:49:11,163 --> 00:49:18,348
One thing I kind of want to talk about is the production story is like when you want to shift to production.

875
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:19,968
Let's add a script here.

876
00:49:22,218 --> 00:49:24,168
build: 'vite build'

877
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,568
So that is literally it.

878
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:35,988
you just run yarn build so anything that's you can have working in dev

879
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:37,578
Theoretically,

880
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:42,498
we guarantee that we guarantee that it will work in build as well.

881
00:49:42,499 --> 00:49:44,688
So if it doesn't work as expected,

882
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:45,738
then it's a bug.

883
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:46,398
we'll fix it.

884
00:49:46,399 --> 00:49:51,708
But the idea is anything that.

885
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:55,638
So we built it,

886
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,418
and we also give you a Vite command called.

887
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:02,118
vite preview.

888
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:09,258
Which we'll just serve this directory that we just build,

889
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:14,448
which is the dist directory and it'll surveyed in production.

890
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:17,268
So this is the production bill.

891
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:21,738
We do a lot of interesting stuff in production for the production build,

892
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:24,108
and so in the features section in our docs here.

893
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:30,348
There is a dedicated section here says Build Optimizations.

894
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:31,698
The native target.

895
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:37,968
The default target build target for vite is browsers that support native es modules.

896
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:40,518
So by default it doesn't support IE 11.

897
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:42,828
So this is something to keep in mind.

898
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:44,628
Vite is modern by defaults,

899
00:50:44,629 --> 00:50:47,598
but we do have opt in support for legacy browsers.

900
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,878
Which I'll talk about in a bit.

901
00:50:49,879 --> 00:51:00,648
But if you're targeting modern only obviously you don't need to do expensive babel, babel preset m transformations which makes the build faster as well.

902
00:51:00,649 --> 00:51:06,198
We automatically polyfill dynamic import so that it works.

903
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:13,368
There is actually a support discrepancy between native es modules and native es modules dynamic import.

904
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,168
So we polyfill that's you just make it.

905
00:51:15,169 --> 00:51:18,429
Even we have CSS code splitting.

906
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:25,038
So if you, all the code splitting in a vite project can be done with just es module dynamic import.

907
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:27,078
We,

908
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,168
because we treat CSS is part of the module graph as well.

909
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:32,238
We can code split CSS.

910
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,488
So if you have async chunk,

911
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:35,628
a lazy route

912
00:51:35,629 --> 00:51:42,918
all the CSS import by that route is split into a separate file and we also when you win,

913
00:51:42,919 --> 00:51:44,268
that chunk is being requested.

914
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:47,838
We fetch the Javascript and CSS in parallel.

915
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,138
Yeah,

916
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:53,898
then ensure the CSS is loaded before the JavaScript module is evaluated.

917
00:51:53,899 --> 00:51:58,248
so you don't get the Flash of unstyled content

918
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,648
So this is all done for you out of the box,

919
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:06,198
you don't need to configure anything if you want to get the same working with webpack

920
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:07,728
it's another story,

921
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:09,408
like you have to look into CSS

922
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:11,358
Many CSS is strapped logging.

923
00:52:12,768 --> 00:52:15,918
All the stuff that question has come up quite a few times,

924
00:52:15,919 --> 00:52:17,238
and I wasn't sure if it was relevant,

925
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:21,468
but server side rendering, we agreed that vite does this,

926
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:24,408
I can imagine server side rendering being a really good story for vite.

927
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:29,118
So vite has currently experimental server side rendering.

928
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,198
Ah,

929
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:31,158
so yes,

930
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:32,118
I can know.

931
00:52:33,048 --> 00:52:39,738
Setting up in from scratch can be a bit involved because of because the idea here is,

932
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,418
but the idea here so.

933
00:52:42,648 --> 00:52:49,398
Let's take a step back and think about what service surrendering what we need with a bundler to get services rendering to work.

934
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:49,998
The idea is,

935
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:53,388
you want your code to be running in GitHub as well,

936
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:55,908
but we are writing.

937
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:57,888
We're writing code.

938
00:52:57,889 --> 00:53:00,558
Thus using ESM

939
00:53:01,698 --> 00:53:07,188
If you are not using like the latest version of node module,

940
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:11,868
latest version of GitHub with native es module support,

941
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:18,339
this code won't run right because previous versions of GitHub exports CommonJS.

942
00:53:18,339 --> 00:53:25,878
And what we are doing here is we provide a programmatic API called ssrLoadModule.

943
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:34,848
So this is inspired by some of the work that Rich Harris is doing in Svelte and the idea is

944
00:53:35,718 --> 00:53:40,428
You can use vite as a middleware inside an existing GitHub server,

945
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:41,508
so if you are doing so,

946
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,988
surrendering you likely want to control the server yourself right so you can use,

947
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:48,858
say I express server run vite as a middleware inside of it.

948
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:55,878
And then use this method called vite.ssrLoadModule.

949
00:53:58,848 --> 00:54:03,828
And load it your server load your server entry like this.

950
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:06,048
That's pretty much it.

951
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:14,058
your server entry runs in GitHub and it can use the same es import syntax to load the rest of your application.

952
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:17,778
Obviously you need to make sure you write your code that is node compatible,

953
00:54:17,779 --> 00:54:28,038
but you can use es module syntax and vite will transform these syntax on the fly into something that's compatible to CommonJS

954
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:30,498
so it can run in GitHub

955
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:33,978
And what we typically do in a webpack,

956
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,448
based as the source setup is,

957
00:54:35,449 --> 00:54:40,848
we actually do a whole ssr bundle as you develop,

958
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:47,898
so it uses webpack to bundle your whole application and output it as CommonJS so that it runs in GitHub.

959
00:54:47,899 --> 00:54:51,618
The downside of this is obviously every time you edit a file,

960
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:57,078
you are be bundling the whole application for a CommonJS.

961
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:05,418
and that is slow with vite when you load this are these modules are similarly cached individually,

962
00:55:05,419 --> 00:55:07,338
like just like in the browser right?

963
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:12,738
One of the reasons we want you to leverage native ESM is because each module is now cached individually.

964
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:15,108
so we do hot module replacement,

965
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:19,638
where only invalidating the specific modules that's being edited.

966
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:20,328
Similarly,

967
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:22,638
for the service are rendering story,

968
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:31,128
we cache all these modules that's specifically instantiated for ssr in our internal module graph,

969
00:55:31,129 --> 00:55:32,568
and when you edit a file,

970
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:36,798
we only invalidate the certain modules that's affected by this specific edit.

971
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:42,588
so you can kind of think of it as hot module replacement for service side rendering during development,

972
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,078
so you never rebundle your whole app.

973
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:52,788
Also vite will smartly externalize dependencies that ships CommonJS.

974
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:54,258
for example,

975
00:55:54,259 --> 00:55:59,208
if you use Vue or React, right, React is already CommonJS

976
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:00,138
So if you use,

977
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:01,548
React in server side rendering.

978
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:02,418
you just required,

979
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:14,418
you don't want to say like bundle it process it that's unnecessary because React shifts as CommonJS so that vite will detect all of these dependencies automatically externalize them,

980
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:17,058
and when you import React

981
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:18,078
it's actually just calling.

982
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,758
require react under the hood so you don't pay the cost of.

983
00:56:23,808 --> 00:56:26,838
Like processing react as part of a bundle,

984
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:30,558
every change in a lot of this is done automatically,

985
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,168
and we have this guide further server side rendering.

986
00:56:35,178 --> 00:56:37,278
If you go to our github repo.

987
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:39,798
we also have actually,

988
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:41,358
I can probably shoot here.

989
00:56:43,788 --> 00:56:48,708
So what you were just explaining does that also fall in line with the context of incremental builds

990
00:56:50,388 --> 00:56:52,308
It's different from incremental builds,

991
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:58,998
so builds are still full because incremental builds are a lot more difficult.

992
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,398
This is mostly focused on the development experience,

993
00:57:01,399 --> 00:57:02,928
like when you're developing.

994
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:03,168
Okay,

995
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:03,948
Gotcha,

996
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:04,368
Yeah,

997
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:06,078
and quick time check,

998
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,048
I'd know we only book this time for an hour,

999
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:10,068
but okay,

1000
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:11,988
I'm good to keep going if you want to keep going,

1001
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:14,118
if you want to finish some your thoughts.

1002
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:22,638
it seems like the chat is really love in this so far are getting the sort of hands on experience and looking over your shoulder.

1003
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:23,178
so,

1004
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:23,478
yeah,

1005
00:57:23,479 --> 00:57:26,148
so if you're interested in server side rendering.

1006
00:57:26,149 --> 00:57:27,918
check out the github repos,

1007
00:57:27,919 --> 00:57:32,478
so we have this pretty comprehensive playground directory in the source code,

1008
00:57:32,479 --> 00:57:38,418
where it has these demo playground of all the major features.

1009
00:57:38,419 --> 00:57:46,128
and these are two fully working server side rendering examples with Vue and React.

1010
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,918
So if you want to try them out,

1011
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:51,018
just use these as references.

1012
00:57:53,568 --> 00:57:54,138
Cool.

1013
00:57:55,728 --> 00:57:55,998
OK,

1014
00:57:55,999 --> 00:57:57,588
so of all this idea,

1015
00:57:57,589 --> 00:58:03,348
there's one thing I still haven't really mentioned up to this point at which is hot module replacement.

1016
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:03,798
so.

1017
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:11,898
I'm going to just create a new one to say cva is my local alias for create vite app.

1018
00:58:11,899 --> 00:58:12,678
Ah.

1019
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:16,818
Each vite demo so I recreate,

1020
00:58:16,819 --> 00:58:20,958
so when you run npm init add vitejs slash app.

1021
00:58:22,278 --> 00:58:26,748
This is also what you'll see so it will run.

1022
00:58:26,749 --> 00:58:29,748
The vitejs create app application on the fly,

1023
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:34,098
and you can pick some of these existing templates that you can go with.

1024
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:37,848
I say I'm going to just go with the basic Vue template here.

1025
00:58:40,128 --> 00:58:41,538
vite view demo.

1026
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:45,408
I'm going to just use my locally links.

1027
00:58:45,409 --> 00:58:46,218
vite

1028
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:47,808
install the dependencies.

1029
00:58:49,128 --> 00:58:51,168
And I get so.

1030
00:58:51,169 --> 00:58:51,588
This is.

1031
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:55,758
Vue three app that's running on vite.

1032
00:58:59,058 --> 00:59:01,548
Let me open this in code.

1033
00:59:06,678 --> 00:59:10,338
So this is very standard if you worked with Vue CLI before,

1034
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:14,928
this will feel right at home right almost of the stuff is the same.

1035
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:18,018
So I obviously if I edit something,

1036
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:18,978
I'm going to.

1037
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:20,808
Hit the counter.

1038
00:59:21,768 --> 00:59:25,488
Just to show that if the HTML doesn't actually glowed a stayed away.

1039
00:59:30,948 --> 00:59:32,898
An html is really,

1040
00:59:32,899 --> 00:59:33,888
really fast,

1041
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:36,438
so the idea here is,

1042
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:39,558
if you're working on a large application,

1043
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:43,758
reloading the page on every edit is obviously not optimal,

1044
00:59:43,759 --> 00:59:48,108
especially say you have some page state where you're like.

1045
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:54,828
I'm want to see how this dropdown look like when I'm tweaking the logic or tweaking the style,

1046
00:59:54,829 --> 01:00:00,198
you want to have the whole application reload and then you have to reopen the drop down every time.

1047
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:03,768
So hot module replacement is one thing.

1048
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:05,628
I believe that sort of eh,

1049
01:00:06,828 --> 01:00:08,208
If the couples,

1050
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:14,748
the feedback speed from the size of the application,

1051
01:00:14,749 --> 01:00:18,858
which is again like the this whole idea of making things faster,

1052
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:21,678
is because personally as it as a developer myself,

1053
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:22,908
whenever I'm working on something,

1054
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:25,518
if I know something is going to take a long time,

1055
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:27,048
I will be reluctant to do it.

1056
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:33,978
It just creates this friction just makes you less likely to do something it makes.

1057
01:00:33,979 --> 01:00:36,588
It makes you enjoy your work less.

1058
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:39,408
so if everything is snappy and fast yours,

1059
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:49,788
you're a happier Developer and happier developers are more productive developers. That's what I believe so and how to make developers happy, make their tools fast.

1060
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:56,478
So that's the whole premise right so here,

1061
01:00:56,479 --> 01:00:57,858
if we take a higher level,

1062
01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:01,608
look at would vite is trying to do here.

1063
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:04,248
Why don't we just use esbuild for everything.

1064
01:01:04,249 --> 01:01:06,198
If it's so fast,

1065
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,908
the thing is,

1066
01:01:07,909 --> 01:01:10,098
even if esbuilt is really fast.

1067
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:16,308
you probably don't want to rebundle or your whole thing on every single edit,

1068
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:17,688
because even it's fast.

1069
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:22,068
If it's going to get slower slower, the size of application grows.

1070
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,668
The idea is,

1071
01:01:22,669 --> 01:01:26,358
I want you to decouple the added feedback from the total size,

1072
01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:27,618
your application,

1073
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:30,228
which is why we need hot module replacement.

1074
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:35,628
But the downside the challenge that we have had in the past is like say,

1075
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:37,158
with webpack

1076
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:38,358
I don't know why.

1077
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:40,188
But in practice,

1078
01:01:40,189 --> 01:01:47,508
we've noticed that webpack's hot module replacement performance just degrades as the size of the application grows.

1079
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:48,498
Technically,

1080
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:50,238
I mean theoretically it shouldn't,

1081
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:54,348
but that's what's happening and say in a large way,

1082
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:56,178
webpack application you,

1083
01:01:56,179 --> 01:02:02,298
even with hot module replacement is not uncommon to wait a few seconds before it. The thing actually finally updates.

1084
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:09,918
but the premise of vite or other native ESM hot module replacement over native ESM.

1085
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:15,078
so the premise is because each module is now cached individually.

1086
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,158
When you edit a file,

1087
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:23,958
we simply invalidate the cache for their specific module and maybe a chain,

1088
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:32,868
an import chain up to all the way where we can say this is this is a reload boundary where we can reimport the module from here.

1089
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:34,518
So say,

1090
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:36,198
when you are editing a Vue file,

1091
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:37,638
the only thing that's being invalidated.

1092
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:38,628
It is this.

1093
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,938
Is this file itself.

1094
01:02:40,939 --> 01:02:45,948
so we're not doing any of the actual work saying like now let's recreated the whole bundle,

1095
01:02:45,949 --> 01:02:48,198
so that then we reload the page right.

1096
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,308
There's nothing like,

1097
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:52,398
then all we're doing and say

1098
01:02:52,399 --> 01:02:52,998
In fact,

1099
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:54,768
if we look at the network tab here.

1100
01:03:01,728 --> 01:03:02,148
God,

1101
01:03:02,149 --> 01:03:02,868
this is too.

1102
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:08,748
Can I clear no not this one,

1103
01:03:08,749 --> 01:03:09,318
this one anyway,

1104
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,788
so uncharted territory for me.

1105
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:13,068
I've never seen such an active network tab.

1106
01:03:14,508 --> 01:03:14,838
Yes,

1107
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:15,978
all right,

1108
01:03:15,979 --> 01:03:18,978
I think the cool thing is like everything is imported individually,

1109
01:03:18,979 --> 01:03:21,228
and so here.

1110
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:24,198
ah,

1111
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:25,518
OK,

1112
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:26,058
this one.

1113
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:30,768
So this is the only new network request that we made every time we adults,

1114
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:35,178
we're just fetching an updated version of this specific file,

1115
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:43,488
and then we apply the updates precisely so we don't reload the whole application.

1116
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:47,268
We don't need to do any bundling work and it just

1117
01:03:47,269 --> 01:03:50,328
It's as precise as it can be.

1118
01:03:50,329 --> 01:03:52,458
As you mentioned things like tree shaking.

1119
01:03:55,368 --> 01:04:00,498
Vite, does it grab stuff that's not being used or actively being leveraged.

1120
01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:10,038
Tree shaking is a more like a production concern because our enduring development you do you don't really worry about loading a few extra kilobytes of.

1121
01:04:12,828 --> 01:04:13,488
In production,

1122
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:14,958
you do want to the leverage tree-shaking

1123
01:04:14,959 --> 01:04:20,504
but that's kind of what the bunglers do I so for production vite still uses bundlers.

1124
01:04:20,504 --> 01:04:26,028
Vite is built on top of Rollup for production and,

1125
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,498
in fact,

1126
01:04:27,499 --> 01:04:31,248
Vite plugins are a super set of Rollup plugins.

1127
01:04:31,249 --> 01:04:34,068
So if you know how to write a Rollup plugin,

1128
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:36,108
you already kind of know how to write a vite plugin.

1129
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:42,078
A lot of the concepts like resolve id, transform load.

1130
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,408
There are exactly the same features,

1131
01:04:45,409 --> 01:04:49,488
extends Rollup's interface to provide a few of vite specific.

1132
01:04:52,218 --> 01:04:56,058
Vite specific properties or hooks,

1133
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,828
so to make it easier.

1134
01:04:59,538 --> 01:05:03,168
So I think that's that's pretty much said,

1135
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:04,608
I don't know if there's anything I can.

1136
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:09,498
I want to talk about what we already talk about like built in frameworks support.

1137
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:17,058
I know there are a bunch of spelt users working on a svelte integration for vite as well.

1138
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:17,748
In fact.

1139
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:25,518
I know a fork of Rollup plugin felt just work pretty much just works in vite.

1140
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:28,758
There's a question that came up about just a point I just mentioned about Rollup

1141
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,828
And why not use esbuild for production.

1142
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:37,458
So the thing here is esbuild for production still has a bunch of things.

1143
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:46,548
so esbuild story for bundling an application is still a little bit incomplete.

1144
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:47,568
I will say,

1145
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:49,488
I think in a feature in the future.

1146
01:05:49,489 --> 01:05:53,478
where esbuild gets more robust application oriented bundling support.

1147
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:55,128
We'll probably you know it's a.

1148
01:05:55,129 --> 01:06:00,918
It's an open possibility that we can switch to it because we already leverage in the lot.

1149
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:02,028
The thing here is,

1150
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:02,718
for example,

1151
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:07,365
you want to have more control over the chunk rendering

1152
01:06:07,365 --> 01:06:15,858
and the into cross import the hash and handling assets, emitting files and then getting the bundle,

1153
01:06:15,859 --> 01:06:18,318
analyzing the bundle optimizing the cross imports.

1154
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:22,386
and all that stuff with esbuild that sort of you know you pretty much.

1155
01:06:22,386 --> 01:06:26,808
You probable don't get any control over the chunking processing in esbuild right now.

1156
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:29,118
So that's something.

1157
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:29,868
and I know.

1158
01:06:29,869 --> 01:06:36,288
Aaron Wallis said he is planning to rewrite code splitting in esbuild at some point.

1159
01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:39,468
So which is why we don't really rely on it.

1160
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:39,768
I mean,

1161
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:42,528
in terms of bundling for applique, bundling applications,

1162
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:44,508
Rollup is still a much more.

1163
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:44,748
I mean,

1164
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:49,368
Battle test in a more robust choice at this point of time.

1165
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:55,818
so obviously it means the production build of vite is going to be much slower than something that you know you.

1166
01:06:55,819 --> 01:06:58,188
leverage esbuild all the way through,

1167
01:06:58,189 --> 01:07:07,068
but the benefit is you get you likely get a more robust and more efficient bundle for production,

1168
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:10,698
so one thing you can do is you can use esbuild as the minifier.

1169
01:07:10,699 --> 01:07:12,348
So the default minifier is terser,

1170
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:17,088
but you can say vite build -- minify esbuild

1171
01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:17,508
ah,

1172
01:07:17,509 --> 01:07:22,398
so we can use esbuild as the minifier which already speeds up the build by quite a bit,

1173
01:07:22,398 --> 01:07:26,898
but in most cases the bundle will be slightly larger.

1174
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:28,968
So it's a tradeoff that you can make them.

1175
01:07:28,969 --> 01:07:30,318
Make your call yourself.

1176
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:31,188
Are you willing to trade?

1177
01:07:31,189 --> 01:07:35,628
Maybe five to ten percent larger bundle in return for faster builds.

1178
01:07:35,629 --> 01:07:36,288
It's up to you.

1179
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:38,448
OK,

1180
01:07:38,449 --> 01:07:39,768
excellent,

1181
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:40,098
yeah,

1182
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:47,478
and I think the last question would be how could folks stay up to date with vite checkout releases?

1183
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:51,906
And are you taking contributions right now as you're approaching the earth leaving the basement

1184
01:07:51,906 --> 01:07:54,738
Yeah, we have a lot of contributors already.

1185
01:07:54,739 --> 01:08:03,648
So the easiest way to stay in touch is go to this Twitter handle adds vite_js

1186
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:05,778
Unfortunately,

1187
01:08:05,779 --> 01:08:10,998
No underscore version has already taken what their product.

1188
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:11,988
yeah,

1189
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:19,968
And so vitejs we have already have a lot of contributors and get help feel free to.

1190
01:08:19,969 --> 01:08:20,238
Oh,

1191
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:23,898
also we have this chat.vitejs.dev

1192
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,188
that's our Discord server.

1193
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:27,738
So if you want to join this later,

1194
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:31,698
I didn't realize Discord was allowing domains.

1195
01:08:32,928 --> 01:08:35,208
This is just a custom redirect.

1196
01:08:35,209 --> 01:08:37,038
OK,

1197
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:37,848
OK,

1198
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:38,718
yeah,

1199
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,768
So chat.vitejs.dev

1200
01:08:42,769 --> 01:08:45,348
You get an automatic invite into our Discord server.

1201
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:48,588
And that's a pretty cool community going on there.

1202
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:51,258
Yeah,

1203
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:53,688
and that's pretty much it.

1204
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:53,988
Yeah,

1205
01:08:53,989 --> 01:08:54,228
well,

1206
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:56,718
I appreciate your time Evan and walk into this.

1207
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:57,738
I think it's a really good,

1208
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:03,378
and I hope you definitely pick up on the live streaming game folks have,

1209
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:04,548
if you have enjoyed this,

1210
01:09:04,549 --> 01:09:06,378
you could actually find Evan.

1211
01:09:06,379 --> 01:09:08,268
He has a Twitter or sorry.

1212
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:08,838
Here's a Twitter,

1213
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:10,758
but he also has a Twitch.

1214
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:13,548
So what you mentioned your twitch is different.

1215
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:16,578
It's a different than what's on the screen?

1216
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:19,008
Twitch is the same.

1217
01:09:19,009 --> 01:09:19,308
OK,

1218
01:09:19,309 --> 01:09:22,758
so everybody to follow Evan on Twitch to make sure whenever he goes live,

1219
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:24,558
showing some some code,

1220
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:25,998
you definitely don't want to miss it,

1221
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:29,508
and if you are interested in learning about more projects,

1222
01:09:29,509 --> 01:09:33,768
definitely follow the channel Open Source Friday we do have a Meetup group for notification reasons,

1223
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:35,748
and I also live stream,

1224
01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:38,448
so my name is here bdougieYO that who I am.

1225
01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:40,158
I do a lot of Github actions work,

1226
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:43,248
which i didn't actually shout out my new t-shirt

1227
01:09:43,249 --> 01:09:46,158
It's they get up shop at the moment to you,

1228
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:47,928
so get it before it sold out,

1229
01:09:47,929 --> 01:09:49,488
and with that,

1230
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:52,068
I think we can go and in the stream,

1231
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:53,478
so thanks everybody.

1232
01:09:55,218 --> 01:09:55,668
Thank you.
